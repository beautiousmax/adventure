adventure
=========

A text-based adventure full of adventures


Introduction
=========

This is a work in progress. I started this project when I was first learning python to get a better understanding of classes and dicts. I have since added a few updates and tweaks, turning the original couple lines of code into a semi-playable and very silly game.

The purpose of the game is open-ended. Currently your character can roam freely around a randomly generated map, populated with buildings, mobs, and items.

Game Play
=========
Start the game by running game_start.py.

```bash
python3 game_start.py
```

*Welcome to the world, adventurer!*

- Travel to a new 'map square' by using the command go <direction>. You can abbreviate "north" to "n", "southeast" to "se", etc.

**go north**

*You are now located on map coordinates (0, 1), which is forest.*

- Pick up / take items found on the map to add them to your inventory

**pick up a bagel**

**pick up the pinecones**

**pick up 2 teapots**

**pick up everything**

**take a shovel**

**take all**


- Eat food items in your inventory

**eat a bagel**

**eat all food**

**eat perishable food**

- Visit buildings

**visit the castle**

- Ask mobs for quests

**ask the man for a quest**

- If you get a quest and want to turn it in, return to the location that has the mob that gave you that quest.

**turn in the quest**

*The homeless man who gave you your quest is not here. You need to go to (1, 2).*

- Check your inventory

**inventory**

*You have three rocks, a laptop, two teapots, five bagels, three pinecones, two piles of kindling, some mysterious berries, an emerald necklace, a box of kleenex, some moss, three piles of mud, a shovel and three sea shells in your inventory.*
