A text-based adventure full of adventures


This is a work in progress. The reason I created this project was to learn classes and dicts better. 


The end goal of this project is to create a virtual world for a player to explore using commands, with a story line to accompany. Currently, the player is able to move around on a map, collect discovered items into an inventory, and throw things.
